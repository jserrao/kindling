# :seedling: Kindling - a custom theme plugin baseline for WordPress devs

If you've made custom WordPress themes before, you know it's a best practice to put your customizations into a separate must-use plugin (for clean upgrades in the future). But where do you start?

This little boilerplate gives you a head start. It does a couple of things out of the box:
* Set up a custom taxonomy
* Set up a custom post-type
* Add custom image sizes to WordPress
* Removes `wp-embed`, `wp-emoji` and `jQuery-migrate`
* How to redirect templates
* How-to rename `post` and `categories` (if you want to do that)

## Contribution Instructions

If you would like to *contribute another action* to this plugin, please make a branch / PR and add it to the plugin file. More structural updates will be considered if there is good rationale

## Roadmap

Potenially breaking this into files with PHP `includes` (maybe?)

#### Good luck with everything.
